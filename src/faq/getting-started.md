**What the heck is this all about?**

The [general introduction](../getting-started/introduction.md) provides a quick overview.

**What is required to launch a TYPO3 instance on AWS?**

Before you can launch a TYPO3-on-AWS machine image, you need an account to use Amazon Web Services' (AWS) products/services (see section "[Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md)"). You can then visit the [AWS Marketplace](../miscellaneous/glossary.md#awsmarketplace){.fa-icon .fa-right-glossary} and launch one of the pre-configured [TYPO3 machine images](../machine-images/index.md).

**How much does it cost?**

This depends on how much you use. The [TYPO3 machine images](../machine-images/index.md) are offered free of charge and they only use free and open-source software by default, so no license fees occur. However, AWS hourly usage fees apply when instances are running.

For example: A very small `t3.nano` instance geographically located in the US costs US $0.0052 per hour. This is US $0.1248 per day or less than US $4.- per month. For a TYPO3 instance in production, you likely require a bigger instance. A `t3.medium` offers 2 vCPU, 4 GiB memory and costs approximately US $1.- per day. The more you use, the more expensive your setup becomes.

One of the great benefits of Amazon Web Services is that you only pay what you use. The [AWS Cost Calculator](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html){.fa-icon .fa-right-external-link-alt} is a well-known tool to calculate/estimate the total costs of your environment.
